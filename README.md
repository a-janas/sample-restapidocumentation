This is my sample "To-do List" REST API Documentation.
It was recruited as a recruitment task where I was tasked to:
  a) improve a provided sample of API Endpoind documentation, correcting only the textual aspects of the document (todo-app-api.yaml)
  b) create a concise and user friendly how-to guide (To-do list REST API.md)

"Images" folder contains images used in the second part of the task.
This repo demonstrates my familiarity with Markdown and yaml files as well as documenting my early trial in creating a Technical Documentation.
